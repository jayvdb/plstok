<H2 ALIGN="center">plstok: A PL/SQL Tokenizer</H2>

<HR>

Plstok is not a separate program -- it is a collection of routines for
recognizing lexical tokens within PL/SQL source code.  It is the core of
the utilities offered at this site.  Because it is open software, you
can modify or enhance it, or you can incorporate it into your own programs.
<P>
Plstok is currently at release level 1.0.0.

<H3>Design Features</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Each token carries the line number and column number where the
corresponding source text occurs.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Plstok can preserve every character of the original source text, including
white space and comments.  The client code can reconstruct the original
source text exactly (in annotated listings, for example).</LI>
<P>
<LI>Optionally, plstok can discard comments and white space so that higher
levels of analysis needn't concern themselves with them.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Plstok recognizes tokens of arbitrary length (such as long string
literals), subject only to memory constraints.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Through the use of a callback function, the source code may come from a
source other than a file (e.g. a database table).</LI>
<P>
<LI>To streamline memory management, plstok caches unused memory blocks for
reuse.  It releases unneeded memory automatically when memory is exhausted.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>Multiple source texts may be parsed concurrently.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Errors are reported in the form of error tokens bearing error messages.
The client code chooses how and whether to issue the messages.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Plstok will detect most lexical errors, i.e. malformed tokens, because it
can hardly avoid detecting them.  An out-of-range numeric literal will escape
detection.  Syntax errors -- i.e. illegal sequences of legal tokens -- are
not its job to detect.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>Other Goodies</H3>

Included are two layers of software which may be useful in other contexts.
<P>
One is a simple memory-management layer which, when compiled in debugging
mode, helps to detect memory leaks.  It also provides a facility for
scavenging memory when resources are low.
<P>
The other is a collection of routines for reading generalized source code.
It keeps track of line numbers and column numbers, and maintains a small
pushback stack for putting characters back into the input stream.
