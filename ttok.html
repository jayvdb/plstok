<HR>

Ttok is pretty useless except as a demo and testbed for plstok, a
tokenizer (lexical analyzer) for PL/SQL source code.  It is mainly useful
for anyone working on plstok, or possibly for someone working on a program
based on plstok.
<P>
Ttok reads a text file of PL/SQL code and tokenizes it.  For each token
it displays the line number and column number where the token begins,
followed by a description of the token.
<P>
Ttok is currently at release level 1.0.0.
