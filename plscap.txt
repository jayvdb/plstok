                               PLSCAP

Plscap is a filter for PL/SQL source code.  It changes all reserved words
to upper case, and all identifiers (other than quoted identifiers) to
lower case, leaving all other aspects of the source code unchanged.

It accepts one optional command-line parameter specifying the name of the
input file.  In the absence of such a parameter it reads standard input.
It writes error messages to standard error; otherwise it writes all output
to standard output.

Plscap is largely intended as a demonstration of plstok, the PL/SQL
tokenizer on which it is based.  In fact the code above the tokenizer
level is trivially simple.  However, for those who like the kind of
capitalization which plscap provides, plscap may actually be useful.
