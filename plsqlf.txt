                              PLSQLF

Plsqlf scans PL/SQL source code looking for string literals and character
literals which contain embedded line feeds.  (The "qlf" part of the name 
stands for "quoted line feed.")  Synopsis:

	plsqlf [filename]

Plsqlf reads the specified file, or standard input if no file is
specified.  It will flag a statement such as the following:

	dbms_output.put_line( 'No employees found for
		specified department' );</PRE>

Such code is legal PL/SQL but may not produce the expected results.
In this example, the intended output is probably:

	No employees found for specified department

The actual output will be:

	No employees found for
		specified department

Whenever it finds such a construct, plsenull writes a message to standard
error, reporting the line number and column number where it occurred.
