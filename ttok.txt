                               TTOK

Ttok is a test driver for the plstok routines.  It reads a text file,
breaks it up into PL/SQL tokens, and displays the results.  It also writes
a second text file, "copy.txt", which should be an exact duplicate of the
input file.  Hence you can verify that the tokenizer preserves all the
information in the original.

Ttok accepts one optional command-line parameter to specify the name of the
input file.  In the absence of such a parameter, ttok reads standard input.

Apart from copy.txt, and apart from some possible error messages written
to standard error, all output is written to standard output.  For each
token, ttok writes the line number and column where the token appears in the
original source text, followed by a description of the token.

When a token consists of a string literal, character literal, or quoted
identifier, ttok displays the contents of the quoted text.  If this text
includes one or more newline characters, ttok will write the newlines as
well.  As a result there may be more output lines than tokens.
